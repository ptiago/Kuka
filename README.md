#Kuka

- Codes in KRL language
- Software admitted based on real cases
- Space for learning

This repository is dedicated to the programs they develop for training in the KRL language used in industrial robots from the Kuka brand.
In addition to testing the use of new functions, instructions, and algorithms, the goal is to create a portfolio, so that other people, industrial robot programmers or not, can exchange ideas and discuss the code in order to always improve our knowledge.

I'm always uploading the backup of the entire cell, so anyone with WorkVisual 6.0 or later will be able to open the whole project.
You can download WorkVisual for FREE and test the code, if possible contribute your idea :)
